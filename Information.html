        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Herald Vann D. Alalim. This portfolio allows me to introduce
          myself and share my understanding of Web Programming (IT103), along
          with the various activities I have participated in. Web programming
          has greatly benefited me by providing a foundational understanding of
          HTML for structuring web pages, exploring the diverse functionalities
          of CSS, and grasping the fundamentals of JavaScript.

        <h2>Guide Questions</h2>
        <div class="question">
          <h3>
            1. How does your portfolio show your skills in HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript as a CS, IS, or EMC student?
          </h3>
          <p>
            For me, a portfolio is a useful tool to showcase your skills. It
            allows you to demonstrate your abilities and also display your
            certifications and awards.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h3>
            2. What projects, awards, and assignments highlight your progress in
            the program?
          </h3>
          <p>
            For me, Week 2 (HTML Part 1) and Week 3 (HTML Part 2) were crucial
            in helping me understand the basic uses of HTML. Week 4 (CSS)
            furthered my understanding by teaching me how to apply design
            elements and various transitions effectively. These activities and
            assignments have significantly contributed to my growth, allowing me
            to explore and understand more about this industry.

          <h3>
            3. How does your portfolio creatively showcase your web programming
            knowledge and experiences?
          </h3>
          <p>
            For me, creating this portfolio is essential as it allows you to
            demonstrate your capabilities and prove your skills. Additionally,
            this portfolio provides a valuable opportunity to explore new things
            and enhance your skills through various projects. I firmly believe
            that working on different projects helps to develop and refine your
            abilities.
