        Hi, I'm Herald Vann D. Alalim. This portfolio allows me to introduce myself and share my understanding of Web Programming (IT103), along with the various activities I have participated in.
        Web programming has greatly benefited me by providing a foundational understanding of HTML for structuring web pages, exploring the diverse functionalities of CSS, and grasping the fundamentals of JavaScript.
